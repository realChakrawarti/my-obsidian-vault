- [[Solar Sail]]: A propulsion system where solar light is used to push the spacecraft forward. The sail which is around the size of a boxing ring, is reflective and super light opens up once the spacecraft is deployed. The logic behind the momentum is, light which consists of photons has momentum, when hits the sail it gets reflected, transferring its momentum to the sail and as it reflect back it also pushes the sail. So, 2 pushes by the photon takes the spacecraft forward. More on this, [Read more](https://www.planetary.org/articles/what-is-solar-sailing)
